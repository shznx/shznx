<h1>Hey whats up ✌️</h1>

My name is Thiago and I'm a Full Stack Web Developer from São Paulo. With solid experience in front-end and back-end technologies, I specialize in creating dynamic web applications. My interests span a wide range of technologies, from innovative frameworks to evolving emerging trends, and I am always eager to take on new challenges.

When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring what's new in games or diving into technology-related projects. <img src="https://i.gifer.com/EsyQ.gif" alt="">
